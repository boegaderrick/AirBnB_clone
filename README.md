# AirBnB Clone

This repository contains an AirBnB clone. It's still in development so it is not exactly there yet. To see what has been implemented so far you will need to run the interpreter located at the root of this repository.

# Command Interpreter / Console
The command interpreter is a program that inherits from 'cmd.Cmd'. It's purpose is to aid in the manipulation of the AirBnB program and all its data. Some of the functionalities currently implemented are:
 * Creation and destruction/deletion of objects
 * Search & retrieval of objects
 * Storage management
 * Display of all objects
 * Object modification or update

To start the interpreter run 'console.py' file at the root of this repo. Type 'help' to see all methods available as at now, to get information about the methods available and how to use them type 'help [method name]'.
